	<p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[15] and specifically designed to have as 
	few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere"  meaning that compiled Java code 
	can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>
	<p>Java was designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling"> James Gosling and developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">
	Sun Microsystems</a> and now owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation"> Oracle Corporation</a></p>
