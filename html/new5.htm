	<p>C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.</p>
	<p>C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.</p>
	<p>C++ was developed by <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup"> Bjarne Stroustrup </a>starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, as an enhancement to the C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983.</p>
	<p>C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.</p>
